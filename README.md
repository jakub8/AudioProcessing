# AudioProcessing
Repo where I learn to process audio with python and make cool things

hit_counter.py
  I have a headband with a ball attached with a stretchy string. You can hit the ball and it comes back, and you hit it again. 
  This file simply looks for peaks in the audio and incremements a counter, and waits until the audio settles down again to detect the next hit.
